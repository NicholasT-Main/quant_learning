    "# Automated Correlation-Based Stock Classification with Machine Learning Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "A comprehensive Python-based system that automatically classifies stocks into correlation-based groups and applies machine learning models for price forecasting. The project incorporated extensive research and testing of multiple correlation methodologies including Pearson, Spearman, EWMA, Rolling Window, Kendall Tau, Partial Correlation, Distance Correlation, Mutual Information, and Copula-Based correlation to determine the optimal approach for financial time series analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through systematic evaluation, EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) correlation was selected as the primary methodology due to its superior ability to weight recent market data more heavily while maintaining computational efficiency in volatile market conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The platform processes 200+ stock tickers with complete daily historical data using the yfinance API, with scalable architecture designed to handle significantly larger datasets. The correlation engine dynamically groups stocks based on configurable minimum correlation thresholds, enabling flexible analysis across different market conditions and sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following comprehensive research and comparative testing of machine learning approaches including Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting methods, and Time Series Transformers, the system implements the optimal forecasting model selected based on performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through systematic evaluation, _______ was selected as the primary forecasting methodology due to its superior performance in [specific reasons to be filled based on testing results].\n",
    "\n",
    "Built with a robust technology stack including Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, PyTorch, and matplotlib for data processing, statistical analysis, machine learning implementation, and visualization. The system emphasizes statistical rigor and quantitative analysis while eliminating human bias from stock classification and prediction processes. Comprehensive performance metrics and backtesting capabilities validate model effectiveness across various market conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Status:** In active development with correlation analysis complete and ML forecasting module in progress.<br>\n",

    "### Pearson Correlation\n",
    "Linear correlation that measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.<br>\n",
    "**Use in stocks:** Not ideal on its own; it gives equal weight to all data points, so it doesn’t capture recent dynamics or handle outliers well.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Spearman Correlation\n",
    "Rank-based correlation that assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic function.<br>\n",
    "**Use in stocks:** More robust to outliers and useful for capturing consistent directional relationships, even if not linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### EWMA Correlation\n",
    "Exponentially Weighted Moving Average correlation that gives more weight to recent data points.<br>\n",
    "**Use in stocks:** Very useful for tracking changing relationships over time, especially in volatile markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Rolling Window Correlation\n",
    "Computes correlation over a sliding window of time, capturing localized relationships.<br>\n",
    "**Use in stocks:** Good for observing short-term changes in correlation, particularly useful in backtesting strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Additional Methods Explored\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kendall Tau Correlation** – Rank-based correlation like Spearman but with a different calculation; slower and more niche, useful for small datasets.<br>\n",
    "**Partial Correlation** – Measures the relationship between two variables while controlling for others; useful when filtering out confounding effects.<br>\n",
    "**Distance Correlation** – Captures both linear and nonlinear relationships; detects hidden dependencies but not limited to -1 to 1 range.<br>\n",
    "**Mutual Information** – Measures how much information one variable gives about another; useful in machine learning and nonlinear analysis.<br>\n",
    "**Copula-Based Correlation** – Captures dependency structures in the tails of distributions; valuable for modeling extreme events and risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "### Choice: EWMA Correlation\n",
    "The choice of correlation method is the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average, this has been chosen as we are working with time series data where more recent values have a larger affect then older values on the market. EWMA Correlation is less computationally expensive as it follows linear time complexity, O(n) due to a single pass through the data, and requires less memory than Rolling Window Correlation as it only requires storing the most recent correlation value."
